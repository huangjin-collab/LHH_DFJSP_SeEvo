**Your Task:**
Create a mutated `{func_name}_v2` function that explores new algorithmic variations.

**Mutation Strategy:**
1. Start from the current best code as a foundation
2. Apply insights from accumulated design knowledge
3. Introduce creative variations (e.g., different weighting, new terms, alternative logic)
4. Balance exploration (novelty) with exploitation (proven strategies)

**Requirements:**
- Output ONLY Python code in a code block: ```python ... ```
- Follow the function signature format
- Ensure code is syntactically correct
- Include brief inline comments for new/modified logic

**Generate the mutated code below:**
