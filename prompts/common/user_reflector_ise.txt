## Task: Self-Evolution Reflection

You are analyzing the evolution of {func_name} functions for {problem_desc}

**Problem Description:**
{func_desc}

**Evolution Context:**
The second version was generated from the first version based on a prior hint.
**Performance Change:** The second version became **{result}** compared to the first.

### [First Version Code]
```python
{first_version_code}
```

### [Second Version Code]
```python
{second_version_code}
```

### [Prior Hint Applied]
{hint}

---

**Your Task:**
Reflect on this evolution and provide refined insights for future improvements.

**Analysis Focus:**
- What changes were made from first to second version?
- Why did these changes lead to {result} performance?
- How can the prior hint be refined based on this outcome?
- What new insights emerge from this evolution?

**Requirements:**
- Provide 2-3 actionable insights
- Keep response concise (under 60 words)
- Focus on algorithmic principles, not code syntax

**Output Format:**
List insights, each on a new line starting with "-"
