## Reference Implementation (Baseline)

{seed_func}

---

**Your Task:**
Create a novel `{func_name}_v2` function that improves upon the reference implementation.

**Guidelines:**
1. Use the reference implementation as a starting point for understanding the structure
2. Be creative - explore significantly different approaches
3. Consider combining multiple strategies or introducing new heuristic components
4. Aim for diversity - avoid simply tweaking coefficients

**Requirements:**
- Output ONLY Python code in a code block: ```python ... ```
- Follow the same function signature format as the reference
- Ensure code is syntactically correct and executable
- Include brief inline comments explaining your approach
