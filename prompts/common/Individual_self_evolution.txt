**Your Task:**
Generate an improved `{func_name}_v2` function through self-evolution.

**Self-Evolution Strategy:**
1. Analyze the evolution from previous to current version
2. Understand what worked and what didn't based on reflection
3. Build upon successful changes
4. Address identified weaknesses
5. Push the design further with additional improvements

**Requirements:**
- Output ONLY Python code in a code block: ```python ... ```
- Follow the function signature format
- Ensure code is syntactically correct
- Include brief inline comments for key improvements

**Generate the self-evolved code below:**
