The composite expression for scheduling job shop operations to determine the subsequent processing of workpieces comprises the following variables:

pt: Processing time of the current operation for all workpieces.
wkr: Remaining processing time for all workpieces.
rm: Remaining processing time for all workpieces except the current operation.
so: Processing time of the succeeding operation for all workpieces.
twk: Total processing time for all workpieces.
ema: **Exponential Moving Average** - A critical feature for handling uncertainty. It tracks the relative deviation between realized and nominal processing times: ema = 0.2·(realized/nominal - 1) + 0.8·ema_prev. 
     - Positive ema indicates operations tend to take longer than planned
     - Negative ema indicates operations complete faster than planned
     - Using ema allows the heuristic to anticipate future time fluctuations and adapt priorities accordingly
     - This is the key mechanism for robust scheduling under fuzzy processing times

The composite expression can include combinations of "+","-", "*", and "/" to represent the relationships between these variables in the scheduling algorithm.

**Important**: Consider incorporating ema to make your heuristic adaptive to time uncertainties. For example:
- Adjust priorities based on deviation trends: pt * (1 + ema)
- Balance urgency with reliability: wkr + pt * ema
- Penalize jobs with high positive ema (running late): pt + wkr * (1 + abs(ema))
