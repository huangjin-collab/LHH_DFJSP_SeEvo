The composite expression for scheduling job shop operations to determine the subsequent processing of workpieces comprises the following variables:

pt: Processing time of the current operation for all workpieces.
wkr: Remaining processing time for all workpieces.
rm: Remaining processing time for all workpieces except the current operation.
so: Processing time of the succeeding operation for all workpieces.
twk: Total processing time for all workpieces.
ema: Exponential Moving Average of the relative deviation between the realised and nominal processing times that a workpiece has experienced so far, ema = 0.2·(realised/nominal ‑ 1) + 0.8·ema_prev.

The composite expression can include combinations of "+","-", and "*" to represent the relationships between these variables in the scheduling algorithm.
